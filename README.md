This repository ("Code - OSS") is where we (Microsoft) develop the Visual

Studio Code product together with the community. Not only do we work on

code and issues here, we also publish our roadmap, monthly iteration plans, 

and our endgame plans. This source code is available to everyone under the

Visual Studio Code

VS Code in action

Visual Studio Code is a distribution of the Code - OSS repository with

Microsoft-specific customizations released under a traditional Microsoft

product license.

Visual Studio Code combines the simplicity of a code editor with what

developers need for their core edit-build-debug cycle. It provides

comprehensive code editing, navigation, and understanding support along

with lightweight debugging, a rich extensibility model, and lightweight

integration with existing tools.

Visual Studio Code is updated monthly with new features and bug fixes. You

can download it for Windows, macOS, and Linux on Visual Studio Code's 

website. To get the latest releases every day, install the Insiders build.
